# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

## About
This is a project about traveling across the US. A guide to great desitnations as you travel across the US. 

## Technologies Used
I've made it so all of the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. I implemented this website from a design in Figma, and then used grid for the first time as well. 

## The Future
Next step is going to be making a dynamic website!
